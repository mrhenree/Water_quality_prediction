## Introduction

Ensuring safe drinking water is vital for public health, yet conventional water quality assessment methods can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) models to predict water potability based on physicochemical parameters such as pH, hardness, and sulfate concentrations. Using a dataset containing various water quality features, models including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) were evaluated based on their precision scores. After hyperparameter tuning, SVC and GBC were combined in a voting classifier, yielding a precision score of 91%. SHAP analysis identified pH and sulfate as key determinants of water potability. This research highlights the potential of ML in water quality prediction, offering a cost-effective alternative to conventional testing methods.

# Water Quality Prediction

The aim of this project is to predict the potability of water given physicochemical parameters such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Sulfate, Conductivity and others.

### Note: A comprehensive breakdown of the project is contained in the jupyter notebook bears the project code "Machine_Learning_Approach_To_Predicting_Water_Quality__An_Evaluation_Of_Potability_Using_Ensemble_Models".
